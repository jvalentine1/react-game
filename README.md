# react-game

## About 

This React.js project is a Looney Tunes themed point and click game. The challenge for the user is to remember the characters which they have already selected, and to accrue as many points as they can without double clicking on a character. 

## How It Works!

Upon visiting the site the user will begin with a score and top score of 0. They will also be prompted to begin by selecting a character.

They will then begin selecting characters. Each time a character that has not been selected already, is clicked, the application will shuffle the charecters into random order and render them to the page. This makes it challenging for the user to remember which charecters have been selected.
